# self-reflection-1
This is the first of three self-reflections that you'll complete during the course. These provide an opportunity for me to learn more about you, check-in on how the course is going, and make sure that getting what you need from the course materials. **This first reflection also helps us set the standards for your assessment in the course.** As such, I'm asking that you complete this in a timely fashion and turn it in by **Aug. 30**.

## Instructions

1. After you've joined the assignment repository, you should have this file (named `Readme.md`) inside of a R project named `self-reflection-1-xx` where `xx` is your github username (or initials). 

2. Once you've verified that you've correctly cloned the assignment repository, [create a new Quarto document](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/authoring/rstudio.html). Name this file `self-reflection-1-xxx.qmd` and give it a title (like M Williamson Self-Reflection 1). Make sure that you select the `html` output option (Quarto can do a lot of cool things, but the html format is the least-likely to cause you additional headaches). We'll be using Quarto throughout the course so it's worth checking out the other tutorials in the getting started section.

3. Copy the questions below into your document and [change the color of their text](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/quarto-slides/).

4. Save the changes and make your first commit!

5. Answer the questions making sure **save and commit at least 4 more times** (having 5 commits is part of the assignment).

6. Render the document to html (you should now have at least 3 files in the repository: Readme.md, self-reflection-1-xx.qmd, and self-reflection-1-xx.html). Commit these changes and push them to the repository on GitHub. You should see the files there when you go to github.com.

## Questions

**About you**

1. Please tell me a little bit about your research interests and how you imagine integrating spatial data in your research. 

2. How do you learn best, and what do you feel is your biggest strength as a student?

3. If you want to, you can set a goal for this semester for something you want to work on in the context of this course (outside of the topic matter itself) – for example, using StackOverflow to get answers to analysis questions or using git to track progress on homeworks. If you choose to set this type of goal, what can you do to help support yourself in working toward that goal? How can I help you to meet this goal?

4. You can, if you choose, also let me know if there is anything else you have going on this semester that you would like me to know about (e.g., field work, other courses, prepping your qualifying exam, working outside of assistantship).

**This Course**

5. Please tell me a little about your prior experience with R ("I use it all the time", "I am still learning", "I've never used it before"). What do you like most about working with R? What are the biggest obstacles for you when working with R?

6. Describe your experience working with spatial data and GIS (either in R, or ArcGIS, or QGIS etc.). How do you tend to use spatial data (e.g., making maps, desiging field sampling, buidling stastical models)? 

7. How do you feel about taking this course (e.g., neutral, positive, negative) and why (e.g., aspects you are worried about, or looking forward to)?

8. After reviewing the syllabus, give some thought to your objectives for this course. Which parts of this course are going to be most useful to your research? What skills do you really want to focus on during the semester? Once you've given this some thought, craft 3-5 SMART objectives for you in this course. SMART objectives are **S**pecific (e.g., I want to make maps in R), **M**easurable (e.g., I want to build _3 maps displaying different elements of a location_ in R), **A**chievable (e.g., I want to build 3 maps displaying different elements of a location _using ggplot_), **R**elevant (e.g., I want to build 3 maps displaying _social and ecological_ elements of a location using ggplot), and **T**ime-bound (e.g., I want to build 3 maps displaying _social and ecological_ elements of a location using ggplot _for the final project_). Try to think about your overall objectives for the course so that we can use to assess your final project. Remember, these objectives should be based in where you are now and where you'd like to be when the course ends. **If you're not sure how to answer this, schedule a meeting with me to chat about it**.

9. Given the grading 'contracts' laid out in the syllabus and your objectives above, what grade would you like to achieve in this course? How will you support yourself in achieving this grade? How can I help?

10. Are there topics on the syllabus that are particularly important for you? What is missing?

**Final Thoughts**

11. Is there anything else you'd like me to know about you or that you want to know about the course?
